        abstract = {This work focuses on improving uncertainty estimation in the field of object classification from RGB images and demonstrates its benefits in two robotic applications. We employ a Bayesian Neural
Network (BNN), and evaluate two practical inference techniques to obtain better uncertainty estimates, namely Concrete Dropout (CDP) and Kronecker-factored Laplace Approximation (LAP). We show a performance increase using more reliable uncertainty estimates as unary potentials within a Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is able to incorporate contextual information as well. Furthermore, the obtained uncertainties are exploited to achieve domain adaptation in a semi-supervised manner, which requires less manual efforts of annotating data. We evaluate our approach on two public benchmark datasets that are relevant for robot perception tasks.},
